Description: Create tcp tunnels trough HTTPS proxies, for using with SSH
 Proxytunnel is a program that connects stdin and stdout
 to an origin server somewhere in the Internet through an industry
 standard HTTPS proxy. I originally wrote this program to be used
 as an extension to SSH, to be able to SSH to my box at home.
