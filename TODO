### Proxy bouncing support
- Add multi-level proxy bouncing support (with syntax for it)
  eg. proxytunnel -p local-proxy:port -r remote-proxy1:port -r remote-proxy2:port -d %h:%p

- Add proxy bouncing authentication support (with syntax for it)
  eg. proxytunnel -p user@local-proxy:port -r user@remote-proxy:port -d %h:%p
  or: proxytunnel -p username:password@local-proxy:port -r username:password@remote-proxy:port -d %h:%p


### SSL proxy support
- Lobby for the Apache project to allow CONNECT over SSL (much like GET,
  PUT and HEAD is supported over SSL)
  see: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29744


### Putty support
- Lobby for the putty project to include ProxyCommand functionality
  see: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/proxy-command.html

- Make proxytunnel build on Windows
---> Should already work, just-recompile and upload new binary to sf.net

### Generic improvements
- Allow to add more than one HTTP header
  eg. -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32)" -H "Keep-Alive: 300" -H "Connection: keep-alive"
---> Work-around is using newlines in your single -H argument
---> But shouldn't be too hard, to support multiple -H's

### Code cleanup
- Fix permissions in subversion tree (some files are wrongly executable)

- Adopt a style guide for C (different styles are now being used)

- Find some hardcore C experts to help us improve the code quality

- Improve the error output, make it consistent throughout the program

- Add different verbosity-levels (with or without data exchange)

- Get rid of the "ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host"
  message when proxytunnel fails to set up tunnel. proxytunnel should give a
  sensible cause instead of the weird ssh error.
  (Users need to understand that proxytunnel fails, not ssh itself)


### Documentation
- Add all documentation in asciidoc standard

- Fix the man page (does not seem to match the current set of options)


### Add default test-cases
- Before releasing proxytunnel, we should validate the different error-cases
  + local proxy does not exist (unresolvable)
  + local proxy exists but does not answer (tcp timeout)
  + local proxy does not talk HTTP
  + local proxy is not a proxy (does not accept CONNECT)
  o remote proxy does not exist (unresolvable)
  o remote proxy exists but does not answer (tcp-timeout)
  + remote proxy does not talk HTTP
  + remote proxy is not a proxy (does not accept CONNECT)
