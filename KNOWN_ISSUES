Known Issues with proxytunnel

Version 1.6
	- Cygwin version doesn't correctly work with getpass(). So asking for
	the proxy password doesn't work. Entering the password on the command-
	line works, as does putting it in a environment variable and telling		proxytunnel about it with -S VARNAME

	- The setproctitle code doesn't work (correctly) on all platforms.
	This needs looking at.
