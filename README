Hi all,

This is proxytunnel, a program that connects stdin and stdout
to an origin server somewhere in the Internet through an industry
standard HTTPS proxy. I originally wrote this program to be used
as an extension to SSH, to be able to SSH to my box at home. In 
this file, I will describe the use with SSH. If you want to use it
with some other application, feel free, and let me know!


Usage:

Proxytunnel is very easy to use, when running proxytunnel with the help
option it specifies it's commandline options.

# proxytunnel --help
Proxytunnel 1.0.5

Purpose:
  Build generic tunnels trough HTTPS proxy's, supports HTTP authorization

Usage: Proxytunnel [OPTIONS]...
   -h         --help              Print help and exit
   -V         --version           Print version and exit
   -i         --inetd             Run from inetd (default=off)
   -u STRING  --user=STRING       Username to send to HTTPS proxy for auth
   -s STRING  --pass=STRING       Password to send to HTTPS proxy for auth
   -g STRING  --proxyhost=STRING  HTTPS Proxy host to connect to
   -G INT     --proxyport=INT     HTTPS Proxy portnumber to connect to
   -d STRING  --desthost=STRING   Destination host to built the tunnel to
   -D INT     --destport=INT      Destination portnumber to built the tunnel to
   -v         --verbose           Turn on verbosity (default=off)

To use this program with OpenSSH to connect to a host somewhere, create
a $HOME/.ssh/config file with the following content:

Host foobar
ProxyCommand /path/to/proxytunnel -g proxy.customer.com -G 8080 -u user
-s password -d mybox.athome.nl -D 443

With:

- foobar		The symbolic name of the host you want to connect to
- proxy.customer.com	The host name of the proxy you want to connect through
- 8080			The port number where the proxy software listens to
- user			Your proxy userid
- password		Your proxy password
- mybox.athome.nl	The hostname of the box you want to connect to (ultimately)
- 443			The port number of the SSH daemon on mybox.athome.nl

If your proxy doesn't require the username and password for using it,
you can skip these options. If you want to run proxytunnel from inetd
add the '--inetd' option.

Most HTTPS proxies do not allow access to ports other than 443 (HTTPS)
and 563 (SNEWS), so some hacking is necessary to start the SSH daemon on
the required port. (On the server side add an extra Port statement in
the sshd_config file)

When all this is in place, execute an "ssh foobar" and you're in business!

Share and Enjoy!
