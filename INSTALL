Short guide to installing proxytunnel

On most modern unix systems, use the normal Makefile
On MAC OS X, use Makefile.darwin
If you don't have gnu-getopts, use Makefile.no-gnu-getopts
On windows/Cygwin, use Makefile.cygwin
etc etc...

If you want to enable setproctitle functionality, add a CFLAGS define
-DSETPROCTITLE (uncomment sample in Makefile)

Run make and optionally 'make install'.
If you manually want to install, copy proxytunnel to /usr/local/bin
and optionally the manual-page from the debian-subdirectory to your manpath
