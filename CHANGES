Changes to proxytunnel version 1.0.6 -- Thu Nov 22 09:35:13 CET 2001

- Added support for compiling on Solaris, uncomment some lines in the
  Makefile to enable this, patch from: Martin Senft <martin@illicon.de>
- Included (modified) patch from Ralph Loader <suckfish@ihug.co.nz> to
  work around broken DNS resolving in some proxies when using DynDNS
  hosts (you need to apply this patch yourself if you want this, it
  isn't enabled by default) -- Maniac

Changes to proxytunnel version 1.0.5 -- Mon Nov 19 21:26:45 CET 2001

- Added support for running from inetd, using the --inetd option or
  the -i option. Also some cleanups in the tunneling code -- Muppet

Changes to proxytunnel version 1.0.4 -- Sun Nov 11 00:44:39 CET 2001

- All the code by Jos and Mark now covered under GPL, the few lines of
  base64 code came from mutt (also GPL), so the entire program is now
  covered by the GPL -- Maniac

Changes to proxytunnel version 1.0.3 -- Sat Nov 10 21:36:42 CET 2001

- Supporting GNU getopts, the entire command line processing has
  changed. If you were using an old version, please check up on the
  '--help' option, and update your .ssh/config files :) -- Maniac

- Added a --verbose option, which occasionally can print some
  interesting details -- Maniac

- Due to getopts, some error handling when entering incorrect command
  line options -- Maniac

- In addition to using http auth, which we allready had, we can now also
  connect to proxy's that do NOT use http auth, simply do not specify a
  username and password. If you specify these, they will be passed on to
  the proxy, otherwise we won't go into auth phase. -- Maniac

- Added simple 'make install' to the makefile -- Maniac
